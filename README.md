# Hello! 👋 I'm Wilfrido Paredes

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I am a Mathematician/Statistician. I'm passionate about machine learning and experimental designs. For several years I worked on Universidad Autónoma de Querétaro as Adjunct Professor where I was involved in several multidisciplinary project from a wide range of areas: Lingüistics, Chemistry and Engineering.

## 🔭 Featured Projects

Currently I'm uploading some reposotories about some projects I've worked at the university:

- [Accidentes](https://github.com/wparedes17/accidentes): A Poisson regression was employed to obtain an explainability model of viality accidents by using city infrastructure variables such as quality of streets, density of schools, bussiness, quality of sign posts, etc.
- [Germinando](https://github.com/wparedes17/germinando): A telegram bot was developed to handle requests for prediction of daily and weekly price of several fruits and vegetables in Queretaro, MX city. One ARIMA model was employed to each product.

You can find more interesting projects and contributions in my repositories. Also you can find information about investigations where I collaborated in my [ORCID Profile](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9740-0358)
